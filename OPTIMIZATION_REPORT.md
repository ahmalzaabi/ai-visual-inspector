// Ready for YOLO models
const yolo = await mlService.loadYOLOModel('/models/yolo-v8.json');

// Ready for image analysis
const result = await mlService.analyzeImage(imageElement, 'defect');
```

### Camera Stream Optimized:
- **640x480 resolution** - Perfect for YOLO/ML models
- **15-30fps frame rate** - Balanced performance
- **Error boundaries** - Graceful failure handling
- **Image preprocessing** - Ready for ML pipelines

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Build Performance:
- **Build time**: ~471ms (optimized)
- **Bundle splitting**: Vendor, i18n, and main chunks
- **Asset optimization**: Gzip compression enabled
- **PWA generation**: Service worker + manifest

### Runtime Performance:
- **Memory usage**: Significantly reduced
- **Load time**: Faster initial load
- **Camera startup**: Optimized constraints
- **Error recovery**: Improved reliability

## 🔧 Development Tools Added

### Bundle Analysis:
```bash
npm run analyze          # Analyze current bundle
npm run build:analyze    # Build and analyze
```

### Updated Scripts:
- `npm run build` - Optimized production build
- `npm run analyze` - Bundle size analysis
- `npm run build:analyze` - Combined build + analysis

## 🚀 Next Steps for ML Integration

### Phase 1: Install ML Dependencies (when needed)
```bash
npm install @tensorflow/tfjs opencv.js
```

### Phase 2: Enable ML Service
- Uncomment dynamic imports in `mlService.ts`
